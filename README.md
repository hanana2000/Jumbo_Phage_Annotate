# 🧬 Jumbo Phage Annotation and Lysogeny/ Biofilm Degradation Filtering

This repository is for a project annotating ~35 jumbo phages and filtering them for lysogenic markers + biofilm degrading enzymes. 
SPHAE and Interproscan are the main tools used: 

- https://github.com/linsalrob/sphae
- https://github.com/ebi-pf-team/interproscan 

to run the scripts provided, it is expected that SPHAE annotation was performed first. Then Interproscan can be run on all CDSs identified by SPHAE, and results can be combined.
